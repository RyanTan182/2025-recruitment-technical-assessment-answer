Apologies for the additional folder for frontend, so here are the steps 
to launch the example page

1. Once you 'cd frontend', enter 'cd frontend' another time to make sure there are 
two frontend folders 

eg. ..\..\2025-recruitment-technical-assessment-answer\frontend\frontend

2. Run 'npm i' to install the libraries/dependencies needed

3. Run 'npm run dev' to launch the dev page
